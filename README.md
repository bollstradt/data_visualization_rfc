# data_visualization_rfc

Jupyter to practice data visualization and one-hot encoding. Then I did feature engineering before training a Random Forest classifier. I'll improve the performance of the model by running Feature Importance on the model. After selecting the most important features, I retrained the model. You can check accuracy improvement in the notebook.
